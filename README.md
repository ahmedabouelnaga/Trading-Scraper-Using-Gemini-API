## üéØ Overview
This script monitors Twitter for congressional trading activity, analyzes tweets using Google's Gemini AI, and logs trading patterns. It runs automatically during market hours and handles data collection safely and efficiently.

## üöÄ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- selenium
- python-dotenv
- google-generativeai
- schedule
- pytz
- ratelimit
- google-api-core

### Configuration
1. Create a .env file in the project root:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

2. Create twitter_handles.txt with Twitter handles to monitor:
```
@handle1
@handle2
```
3. Install Firefox (required for Selenium)
## üîß Usage

### Starting the Script
```bash
python trades_analyzer.py
```

The script will:
- Run as a daemon process on Unix systems
- Schedule analysis for market hours (9:30 AM EST on weekdays)
- Log activities to trades_analyzer.log
- Store results in congress_trades.json

### Stopping the Script
- Press Ctrl+C for graceful shutdown
- The script will complete current tasks before exiting
- For emergency stop: find PID in trades_analyzer.log and use `kill -9 PID`

## üìä Output
Results are stored in congress_trades.json:
```json
{
  "trading_sessions": [
    {
      "date": "2024-01-01",
      "market_open_time": "Monday, January 1, 2024 09:30:00 AM EST",
      "analyses": [
        {
          "member_name": "CongressPerson",
          "company_traded": "$STOCK",
          "trade_direction": "good/bad",
          "trade_magnitude": 1-10,
          "tweet_text": "original tweet",
          "timestamp": "analysis time"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîç Features
- Multi-threaded tweet processing
- Automatic restart on critical errors
- Rate limiting and retry logic
- Daemon process support
- Rotating log files
- Thread-safe file operations
- EST/EDT timezone handling
- Graceful shutdown handling

## üìù Logs
- Main log: trades_analyzer.log (rotates at 10MB)
- stdout.log: Standard output
- stderr.log: Error messages

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration
Edit these variables in trades_analyzer.py:
```python
HEADLESS_MODE = True  # Run Firefox in headless mode
WAIT_TIMEOUT = 10     # Selenium wait timeout
MAX_THREADS = 5       # Maximum concurrent threads
THREAD_TIMEOUT = 300  # Thread completion timeout
```

## üõ† Troubleshooting
1. Selenium issues:
   - Ensure Firefox is installed
   - Check geckodriver compatibility

2. API errors:
   - Verify GEMINI_API_KEY in .env
   - Check API quota limits

3. Process won't start:
   - Check log files for errors
   - Verify file permissions

## üìö Security Notes
- Never commit .env file
- Monitor API usage
- Respect rate limits
- Review logs regularly
- Keep packages updated

## ü§ù Contributing
This is an educational project. While contributions are welcome, remember:
- Follow ethical scraping practices
- Respect API terms of service
- Add proper error handling
- Document changes thoroughly

## ‚öñÔ∏è Legal
This tool is provided "as is" without warranty. Users are responsible for:
- Complying with API terms of service
- Respecting website scraping policies
- Following applicable laws and regulations
- Managing their own API keys and usage

## üéØ Quick Test Mode
To test the scraper immediately without waiting for market hours:
1. Open trades_analyzer.py
2. Find the schedule_market_open() function
3. Comment out the market hour schedules and uncomment the test mode line:
```python
# Comment out these lines for testing:
# schedule.every().monday.at("09:30").do(run_analysis)
# ...market schedules...

# Uncomment this line for immediate testing:
run_analysis()  # This will run the analysis immediately
```

## üõë Controlling the Script
### Graceful Shutdown
1. Find the process ID (PID):
   ```bash
   cat trades_analyzer.log | grep "Process ID"
   # Or on Unix systems:
   ps aux | grep trades_analyzer.py
   ```
2. Stop the script gracefully:
   ```bash
   kill <PID>
   ```
   This allows current tasks to complete.

### Emergency Stop
```bash
kill -9 <PID>
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Use only if graceful shutdown doesn't work.

### Monitoring Status
1. Check if running:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep trades_analyzer.py
   ```
2. View real-time logs:
   ```bash
   tail -f trades_analyzer.log
   ```
3. Check heartbeat logs (hourly status updates)

## üìã Dependencies Details
### Required System Components
- Firefox Browser
- Python 3.8+
